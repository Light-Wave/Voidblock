# Voidblock

A blend between Sky Island and Innawood that focuses more on exploring the island and survive on it, rather than raiding the mainland. Also includes Magiclysm.

# Overview

This mod attempts to change Sky Block to be more Innawood-like. Your starting island has a lot more features, allowing you to survive and prosper on it whithout leaving all that often. Expeditions can be used to gain large quantities of resources you might otherwhise struggle to aquire on the island itself. But most progression will happen on the island.

# Changes

- The island has a hand-crafted map to explore
- You need to create some clean water and survive 48 hours before the island let you go on expeditions or heal you from dying on the island. (You can't just ignore survival in the begining)
- The forge of wonder can be visited from the expedition obelisk. This costs 1 invitation per visit. Invitations can be found from foraging.
- Long sticks can be created without an infinity tree, but requires a long stick.
- Other wooden items requre tools to generate from the infinity tree. Same tools as you would need to aquire them normaly. (woodcuting tool for logs, for example)
- Withered plants can be crafted from material tokens without any workstation
- cottonwood balls can be made from the infinity tree
- Starterkit items spawning on the island has been removed
- Removed urban expedition targets
- Some autodoc items are no longer autolearned
- Give exp from expeditions equal to material tokens earned (doesn't seem to work)
- Give 25 exp for completing the Find the warp shards! quest (doesn't seem to work)
- Removed underground bunker stuff (Building, fixing, items, quests) (You're meant to build your onw base, not have the island build it for you)
- Got rid of the pond creation

#TODO

- Cave system
- Change quest craftables
- Make magiclysm gatway thingies return you to the island instead
- Change scenario starting gear

#TODO before the mod gets officially released

- Find a better name for the mod. Innavoid? Sky Grove? Skywoods? In the Sky? Fey Realm? Wood Between the Worlds? The Woods Between?
- Modify json/ui/zenfs/mod_SI.json
- Modify mods/Xedra_Evolved/mod_interactions/skyisland/paraclesian_eocs.json, or add my own mod folder
- Possibly change EOC_safely_landed in Sky_Island

#TODO for later versions of the mod, probably won't be in first release

- Remove/rework autodock stuff, including construction groups? (Figgure out how to remove construction groups)
- Other ways to find forge of wonder invitations (Buy them from the forge? Rare monster loot? dangerous location loot?)
- Consider not healing hunger and thirst when dying, having that be 'true death' conditions. This is a survival game, after all.
- Add magiclysm specific quests, like slay goblins, or a golem?
- Rework the forge of wonders scryer to grant landing points instead of revealing locations?
- Rework explanation in dialog_statue
- Add innawood and magiclysm specific starting locations, like caves, or goblin camps
- Break out the magiclysm/sky island changes more? Version handling.
- Move logic from the voidblock mod into the sky island mod
