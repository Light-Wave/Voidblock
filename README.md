# Voidblock
A blend between Sky Island and Innawood that focuses more on exploring the island and survive on it, rather than raiding the mainland.

# Overview
This mod attempts to change Sky Block to be more Innawood-like. Your starting island has a lot more features, allowing you to survive and prosper on it whithout leaving all that often. Expeditions can be used to gain large quantities of resources you might otherwhise struggle to aquire on the island itself. But most progression will happen on the island.

#TODO
- Remove/rework autodock stuff, including construction groups?
- Rework explanation in dialog_statue
- Remove underground bunker stuff (Building, fixing, items, quests)
- Change scenario starting gear
- Cave system

# Changes
- The island has a hand-crafted map to explore
- Long sticks can be created without an infinity tree, but requires a long stick.
- Other wooden items requre tools to generate from the infinity tree. Same as you would need to aquire them normaly.
- Starterkit items spawning on the island has been changed to be more Innawood-themed
- Removed urban expedition targets
- Some autodoc items are no longer autolearned
